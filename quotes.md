> Always write down the probability of everything.
Steve Gull

> From this joint probability, any desired inference can be mechanically obtained.
David MacKay

> Information is the resolution of uncertainty. 
Claude Shannon

> the most probable outcome from a source is often not a typical outcome from that source. Similarly, the most probable hypothesis given some data may be atypical of the whole set of reasonably plausible hypotheses.
David Mackay

> Coherent inference (as embodied by Bayesian probability) automatically embodies Occam’s razor, quantitatively.
David Mackay

> you cannot do inference without making assumptions
David Mackay

> Thus probabilities can be used to describe assumptions, and to describe inferences given those assumptions. The rules of probability ensure that if two people make the same assumptions and receive the same data then they will draw identical conclusions.
David Mackay

> Bayesian inference is an approach to statistics in which all forms of uncertainty are expressed in terms of probability.
Radford Neal

> Monte Carlo is an extremely bad method; it should be used only when all alternative methods are worse.
Alan Sokal

> Probability calculus, often called "Bayesian", is not an option to be accepted, modified or rejected at whim. It has a firm logical basis as the unique calculus of rationality.
John Skilling

> Bayesian statistics only offers one answer to a well-posed problem
David Mackay

> How can one perform inference without making assumptions? I believe that it is of great value that Bayesian methods force one to make these tacit assumptions explicit.
David MacKay

> once assumptions are made, the inferences are objective and unique, reproducible with complete agreement by anyone who has the same information and makes the same assumptions.
David Mackay

> when the assumptions are explicit, they are easier to criticize, and easier to modify – indeed, we can quantify the sensitivity of our inferences to the details of the assumptions
David Mackay

> As always, probability theory is ashamed of just being a particular case of measure theory, and insists on having its own vocabulary.
Stéphane Dupraz

> The goal of inference is, given a defined hypothesis space and a particular data set, to assign probabilities to hypotheses
David Mackay

> The actual science of logic is conversant at present only with things either certain, impossible, or entirely doubtful, none of which (fortunately) we have to reason on. Therefore the true logic for this world is the calculus of Probabilities, which takes account of the magnitude of the probability which is, or ought to be, in a reasonable man’s mind
James Clerk Maxwell

> We are hardly able to get through one waking hour without facing some situation (e.g. will it rain or won’t it?) where we do not have enough information to permit deductive reasoning
Edward Jaynes

> the only real limitations on making “machines which think” are our own limitations in not knowing exactly what “thinking” consists of.
Edward Jaynes

> The most important questions of life are indeed, for the most part, really only problems of probability.
Pierre Simon Laplace

> Probability theory is nothing but common sense reduced to calculation.
Pierre Simon Laplace
