\frontmattersection{Lay summary}
\thispagestyle{plain}

A lay summary is intended to facilitate knowledge exchange, public engagement and outreach. It should be in simple, non-technical terms that are easily understandable by a lay audience, who may be non-professional, non-scientific and outside the research area.

Abstracts, particularly in science, engineering, medicine and veterinary medicine, may be highly technical or contain scientific language that is not easily understandable to readers outside the research area. Therefore, the lay summary is intended as supplementary to the abstract.
